DONE:
-util:
    -prevent_quat_jump_pytorch
    -quat_to_exp_pytorch
- check abc library for compatibility
- check pickle library and os
------------------------------------
- batched contact 
- batched basic_contact 
- batched task 
- batched basic_task <-- needs revision TODO
- batched internal_constraints 
- batched Draco3RollingJointConstraint in draco3_pnc



TODO:
-batched basic_task: do "LINK ORI" --> need orbit; R.from_quat; R.from_matrix
- when done check represenatation of quaternions(last value scalar) to update_desired in task
-test
- check data saver: add function
- Scipy functions: 
    - scipy.spatial.transform.Rotation  (class)  -> basic_task
            - from_quat
            - from_matrix






No need to translate right now:
    - change robot source code: example:
            - get link jacobian   #must be batched
            - get_link_jacobian_dot_times_qdot #must be batched
            - get link iso   #must be batched
            - joint_positions #must be batched
            - joint_velocities #must be batched
        - robot: -n_floatnig must be constant int not batched
                 - n_a not batched


        
QUESTIONS:
- One contact (task/tci_container) class for each sim so variables and operation inside are batched
- Or each sim has it's own contact class etc so not batched
- rf_des; we put it as n_batch. Problem it could not exist -->should set to 0 always
