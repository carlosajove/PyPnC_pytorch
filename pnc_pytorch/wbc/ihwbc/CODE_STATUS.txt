DONE:
- changed numpy to pytorch, assuming function inputs are torch
- created funciton in utils
- create equivalent to scipy.linalg.block_diagram, using pytorch
        - revised 
- implement torch compatible solver 
- Implement dimensions as [n_batch, etc]
- joint integrator not needed in simulation, so no q and qdot

TODO:
- check data_saver function (self.data_saver.add())
- testing 

QUESTIONS:
- related to internal_constraint code status:
    - internal_constraint_list (list n_batch x list of InternalConstraint):
    - internal_constraint_list(lits of batched InternalConstraints) <---- I'm going with this approach

- Seung Hyeon:
    - Why uses ni in equality constraints
    - differences between paper model and code model



- pytorch qp solver and mpc is less robust to input matrices. They must be full rank, with
