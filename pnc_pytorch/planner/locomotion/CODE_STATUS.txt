TODO:
- for the mpc pytorch, we can not bound the x, that means we must bound the dynamics
  possible solution: - compute dynamics and if bigger than x_max then equal to x_max
                     - problem: the optimization problem the optimizer understands that for those u's we have x limited but real x could be infinity

QUESTIONS:
- operations on numbers run on CPU, how do we make them run on CPU
