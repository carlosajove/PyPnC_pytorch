DONE:
-erased dcm
-erased towr+
- mpc done

TODO:
- for the mpc pytorch, we can not bound the x (we could maybe bound the dynamics) --> problem maybe understands unfeasable dyns


QUESTIONS:


-The MPC is only computed at the beginning of the step. How do i make sure since the mpc is computed for all the robots at the same time,
  I need all the robots to land the foot at the same time. In theory this is okay, because Ts is the same. On reality will have different swing times,
  need to stop and wait till all the robots have completed the swing? 

- Or can put the MPC in N * control freq and compute as with Tr
